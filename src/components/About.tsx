                  For more than fifty years, Reeves has occupied the corner of
                  Taft and Fairview in Houston&rsquo;s Midtown — a family
                  business built on three generations of expertise in antiques,
                  mid-century modern furniture, and fine art. Respected by
                  artists, collectors, interior designers, and cultural
                  institutions alike, Reeves has earned a quiet reputation for
                  straight dealing, discernment, and genuine care.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Reeves Estates is the natural extension of that legacy — a
                  full-service estate handling solution for families and
                  executors who want every detail managed with sensitivity and
                  expertise, from the first conversation to the final close.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our 5,000 square foot gallery space sets us apart. Rather than
                  a rushed sale in a private home, we bring the estate to
                  Midtown — carefully staging and presenting pieces in a
                  considered, gallery-quality environment that honors the
                  collection and attracts serious buyers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We offer three distinct paths depending on your needs. For
                  estates best suited to an organised sale event, we handle
                  everything in-house — curation, marketing, staffing, and
                  execution. For collections of particular significance, we
                  conduct private liquidations with discretion and care. And for
                  families who prefer the familiarity of their own home, we
                  manage professional on-site sales events at the property
                  itself — combining the intimacy of the setting with the reach
                  and organisation of a seasoned team.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whatever the circumstances, Reeves Estates offers one point of
                  contact, one trusted family name, and a commitment to handling
                  every piece — and every family — with the respect they
                  deserve.
