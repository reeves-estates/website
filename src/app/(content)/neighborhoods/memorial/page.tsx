                Memorial is one of Houston&rsquo;s most established neighborhoods
                — large properties, long tenures, and collections that reflect
                decades of considered living. The estates we handle here often
                include significant furniture, fine art, mid-century pieces,
                silver, and objects that have been in families for generations.

              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                That kind of accumulation deserves more than a hurried clearance.
                It deserves someone who can identify what&rsquo;s valuable, place
                it properly, and return fair value to the family — not just move
                things quickly.

                Reeves Art + Design has operated in the Houston market since
                1969. The relationships we&rsquo;ve built with collectors,
                dealers, and institutions across the city are what allow us
                to find the right outcome for each piece — not just the
                fastest one.

                We hold estate sales at our 5,000 square foot gallery in
                Midtown Houston. For Memorial families, this matters. A
                gallery setting attracts buyers who are specifically looking
                for quality — collectors, interior designers, and private
                individuals who understand what they&rsquo;re purchasing and
                are prepared to pay accordingly.

              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                We handle every detail: the walkthrough, the cataloging,
                the pricing, the staging, and the sale itself. You receive
                a full accounting at close. Proceeds are distributed promptly.

              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                For families who prefer that the sale take place at the
                property, we also manage professional on-site sales events —
                with the same standards, the same team, and the same result.

                Not every family has the time or bandwidth for a full estate
                sale process. Executors working on probate timelines, families
                managing things from out of town, properties that need to be
                cleared before a sale — these situations call for a different
                approach.

              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                Our cash buyout service purchases the entire estate outright.
                One offer, one payment, one close. We handle all removal and
                clearance and leave the property ready for whatever comes next.
                A fair cash offer is typically delivered within 48 hours of
                our initial visit.

                producing written reports that hold up for estate attorneys,
                courts, insurance carriers, and the IRS.

                Memorial properties frequently contain pieces that reward
                careful attention: Texas art, significant mid-century furniture,
                collections of decorative objects assembled by people who knew
                what they were doing. We give those pieces the time they deserve.
