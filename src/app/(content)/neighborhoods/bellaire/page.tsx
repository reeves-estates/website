            The estates we handle here reflect that — and so does the

                Bellaire has been one of Houston&rsquo;s most desirable
                communities for decades — a place where families put down
                deep roots and homes accumulate real history. The estates
                here often hold a lifetime of carefully chosen belongings:
                fine furniture, artwork, silver, collections built piece
                by piece over many years.
              </p>
              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                When it&rsquo;s time to settle an estate, the people
                involved deserve a company that takes that history seriously.
                One that doesn&rsquo;t rush, doesn&rsquo;t guess, and
                doesn&rsquo;t treat the process as a transaction to be
                completed as quickly as possible.

                Reeves Estates has served families like yours across Houston
                since 1969. We bring the same expertise, the same honesty,
                and the same patient approach to every Bellaire engagement.

                We hold estate sales at our 5,000 square foot gallery in
                Midtown Houston — close to Bellaire and well-known to the
                buyers who matter. The gallery setting attracts collectors,
                interior designers, and private buyers who are specifically
                looking for quality and understand its value.
              </p>
              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                We manage the entire process: walkthrough, cataloging,
                pricing, staging, marketing, and the sale. You receive
                a complete accounting at close and proceeds are distributed
                without delay.

              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                If the family prefers a sale at the property, we organize
                and staff professional on-site events as well — the same
                care and expertise, at the home itself.

                deadlines, a property under contract, an executor managing

                exactly that.

                We assess the estate, deliver a fair cash offer within

                A proper appraisal is the starting point for any estate

                worth in today&rsquo;s market.

                and they give every family member confidence that the estate
                is being handled fairly and thoroughly.
