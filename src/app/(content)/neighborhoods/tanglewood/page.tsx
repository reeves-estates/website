            Tanglewood is one of Houston&rsquo;s most storied addresses.
            The estates here reflect that — and so does the care we bring
            to handling them.

                Tanglewood has been home to Houston&rsquo;s business and
                civic leadership for generations. The estates we handle
                here reflect that history — significant art collections,
                antique furniture, fine silver and porcelain, and mid-century
                pieces that were acquired with real knowledge and care.
              </p>
              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                These aren&rsquo;t collections that should be sold quickly
                or handled by someone who can&rsquo;t tell the difference
                between a notable piece and a reproduction. They deserve
                specialists — people who have spent decades in the market
                and know exactly what they&rsquo;re looking at.

              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                Reeves Art + Design has been part of the Houston art and
                antiques market since 1969. That depth of experience is
                what Reeves Estates brings to every Tanglewood engagement.

                We conduct estate sales at our 5,000 square foot gallery
                in Midtown Houston — a professional environment that draws
                the kind of buyers Tanglewood collections deserve. Serious
                collectors. Interior designers working at the highest level.
                Private buyers who know quality and are willing to pay for it.

                Everything is managed in-house: the initial walkthrough and
                assessment, cataloging and research, pricing, staging, marketing,
                and the sale itself. You receive a detailed accounting at close
                and proceeds are distributed promptly.

              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                For pieces of particular significance, we look first at
                private placement — connecting directly with known collectors
                and specialist dealers before recommending any public channel.
                The right buyer for the right piece often isn&rsquo;t found
                in a general sale.

              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                We assess the estate, make a fair offer, and if it works for
                you, we handle everything from there. All removal, all
                clearance, one payment. The property is left clean and
                ready for whatever comes next. We typically deliver an
                offer within 48 hours of our initial visit.

                A proper appraisal is the foundation of any well-managed
                estate. Before decisions are made about what to sell, donate,

                actually have.

                Our written valuations document each item with provenance,

                the requirements of estate attorneys, courts, insurance
                carriers, and tax filings — and they protect every member
                of the family by ensuring that nothing of value is
                overlooked or undervalued.
