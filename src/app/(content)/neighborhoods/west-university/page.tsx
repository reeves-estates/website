                West University Place is one of Houston&rsquo;s most enduring
                inner-loop neighborhoods — the kind of place where families
                stay for decades and homes hold generations of accumulated life.
                The estates we handle here often reflect that depth: furniture
                passed down through families, art acquired over a lifetime,
                objects that carry both monetary and personal value.
              </p>
              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                Handling an estate like this well means slowing down enough
                to understand what you have. It means knowing the difference
                between a piece that deserves individual attention and one
                that belongs in a general sale. And it means communicating
                honestly with the family throughout.
              </p>
              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                That&rsquo;s what Reeves Estates has done since 1969 — and
                what we bring to every West University engagement today.

                We hold estate sales at our 5,000 square foot gallery in
                Midtown — just minutes from West University Place. The gallery
                setting matters: it brings in buyers who are specifically
                seeking quality, and it allows us to present each piece the
                way it deserves to be seen.

                We manage every step in-house. Walkthrough and assessment.
                Cataloging and pricing. Staging and marketing. The sale itself.
                A full accounting at close, with proceeds distributed promptly.

              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                Families who prefer a sale at the property can also opt for
                a professionally managed on-site event — the same team, the
                same standards, the same commitment to a fair result.

                Some families need this resolved quickly and completely.
                A property under contract, an out-of-town executor, a timeline
                that doesn&rsquo;t allow for a multi-week sale process — these
                are the situations our cash buyout service is built for.

                We make a fair offer on the entire estate within 48 hours of
                our visit. If it works for you, we handle all removal and
                clearance and leave the property clean. One transaction.
                No commissions. No uncertainty.

                Our written appraisals document each item with provenance,
                condition notes, and current market comparables — reports
                that satisfy estate attorneys, courts, insurance carriers,
                and the IRS.

                For West University estates with significant art, antiques,

                good decision that follows.
