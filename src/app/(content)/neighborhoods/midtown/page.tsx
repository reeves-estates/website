                Reeves Art + Design has occupied the corner of Taft and Fairview
                in Midtown since 1969. That history isn't a marketing point —
                it's the reason we understand this city's art market, collector
                community, and the kinds of collections that Houston families
                have built over generations.

              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                Our 5,000 square foot gallery is where we bring estates to be
                sold properly. Not in a rushed home sale, not in a cluttered
                auction house — but in a considered, gallery-quality environment
                that attracts serious buyers who recognize quality when they see
                it.

              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                For Midtown families and executors, working with us means working
                with people who are genuinely part of this neighborhood — and
                have been for more than fifty years.

                Midtown Houston has changed considerably over the decades, but it
                has always attracted people with genuine taste — artists,
                collectors, professionals who care about what surrounds them.
                The estates we see here reflect that: fine art, well-chosen
                antiques, quality furniture, and objects that have been
                thoughtfully accumulated over time.
              </p>
              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                We approach each estate the same way — thorough walkthrough, honest
                assessment, clear recommendation. For most Midtown estates, our
                gallery sale is the right path. For pieces of particular
                significance, we look at private placement first.
              </p>
              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                We also offer complete cash buyouts — one offer, one payment, fast
                closing — for families or executors who need certainty more than
                they need to optimize every line item.
