            Upper Kirby is well-placed and well-considered. The estates here
            reflect decades of intentional living — and deserve to be
            handled that way.

              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                Upper Kirby draws from the residential character of River Oaks
                and West University to the north and west, and the cultural
                density of Montrose and the Museum District to the east. It's a
                neighborhood where long-established families and newer arrivals
                coexist — and where the estates we encounter tend to be as
                varied as the people who built them.

              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                What they share, more often than not, is quality — furniture
                chosen with care, art acquired over time, and objects that
                meant something to the people who owned them. That's exactly
                what we're equipped to handle.

                Our gallery on Taft Street in Midtown is less than two miles
                away. When we bring an Upper Kirby estate to our showroom, it
                reaches collectors and buyers from across the city who
                understand what they're looking at.

              How we approach an Upper Kirby estate
            </h2>
            <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                We start with a walkthrough — a thorough, unhurried review of
                everything in the property. We identify what has real value,
                what belongs in a gallery sale, and what might warrant a
                private placement with a specific buyer. We tell you what we
                think honestly, before any commitment is made.
              </p>
              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                For most Upper Kirby estates, our gallery sale is the right
                answer. We handle everything: cataloging, staging, marketing,
                the sale itself, and the clearance afterward. You receive a
                full accounting and a property left clean.
              </p>
              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                If speed and certainty matter more than maximizing every item,
                our cash buyout is available as well — one offer, one payment,
                and we handle the rest.

              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                Upper Kirby estates frequently include pieces that benefit from
                specialist knowledge: Texas art, mid-century furniture by
                recognized designers, decorative antiques, estate jewelry, and
                silver. A generalist will often miss the mark on value — either
                undervaluing what's significant or overvaluing what isn't.
              </p>
              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                Our team brings decades of expertise in exactly these
                categories. We document each significant item with provenance,
                condition notes, and current market comparables — and we make
                sure nothing of value goes unrecognized.
