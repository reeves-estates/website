                River Oaks is home to some of Houston&rsquo;s most significant
                private collections — fine art, antique furniture, estate
                jewelry, silver, and mid-century pieces accumulated over
                generations. Settling an estate here isn&rsquo;t the same as
                settling one anywhere else.

              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                The stakes are higher. The buyers are more discerning. And the
                families involved have every right to expect a company that
                knows what it&rsquo;s handling — not just logistically, but in
                terms of genuine market knowledge.

              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                Reeves Art + Design has been part of the Houston art market
                since 1969. That history is what makes Reeves Estates the right
                call for River Oaks families. We don&rsquo;t guess at values.
                We know them.

              How we work with River Oaks estates

              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                We start with a thorough walkthrough of the property. No
                pressure, no obligation — just an honest conversation about
                what you have and what your options are.
              </p>
              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                For most River Oaks estates, we recommend bringing the
                collection to our 5,000 square foot gallery in Midtown Houston.
                Our gallery environment attracts the right buyers — collectors,
                interior designers, and private individuals who understand
                quality and are prepared to pay for it. A home sale, even a
                well-run one, rarely achieves the same result.
              </p>
              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                For pieces of particular significance — a painting, a piece of
                sculpture, notable silver or porcelain — we look first at
                private placement with known collectors before recommending any
                public sale. Some things belong in the right hands, and we have
                the relationships to make that happen.

                Sometimes a family needs this handled quickly and completely.
                There are out-of-town executors, probate timelines, properties
                that need to be listed, and relatives who simply cannot manage
                a drawn-out process.

                Our cash buyout service purchases the entire estate outright —
                one offer, one payment, one close. We handle all removal and

                comes next.

                River Oaks estates regularly include pieces that deserve
                individual attention: Texas regionalist paintings, significant
                European antiques, Mid-Century Modern furniture by recognized
                designers, and collections of decorative art that have been
                carefully assembled over a lifetime.

              <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-charcoal/75">
                Our appraisal team documents each item with provenance, condition
                notes, and current market comparables. These reports hold up
                for estate attorneys, courts, insurance carriers, and tax
                filings — and they ensure that nothing of value gets missed,
                undervalued, or sold for less than it should be.
